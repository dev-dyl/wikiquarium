# wikiquarium
JavaScript animated webpage with random Wikipedia links as fish in an aquarium!

This was designed for a WordPress site using a custom child theme. If you wish to adapt this as a standalone, you will have to edit the css and js hrefs in index.html.
If anyone knows a good way to avoid this issue, please let me know!
